**October 31st, 2022**

# Roadmap
1. In the beginning we should have a web site with a column centered in the middle of the screen.
This column will show the tittle of any story at the top.

2. Bellow the tittle, I want to insert a button to change the history by bringing in a random item from a scary stories list.

3. Below the button, I will leave some phrase to instruct the user to read the current story.

4. About the body, I want to customize with different arts and interections for the user to read and feel different emotions.

5. Regarding the page footer, I will leave the number of the current position of the history list.
